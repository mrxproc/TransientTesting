<title>Step Errors</title>

<para>Several of the steps in the standard step library can generate
<glossterm baseform="dynamic-error">dynamic errors</glossterm>.</para>

<para>A <termdef xml:id="dt-dynamic-error">A <firstterm>dynamic
error</firstterm> is one which occurs while a pipeline is being
evaluated.</termdef> Examples of dynamic errors include references to
URIs that cannot be resolved, steps which fail, and pipelines that
exhaust the capacity of an implementation (such as memory or disk
space).</para>

<para>If a step fails due to a dynamic error, failure propagates
upwards until either a <tag>p:try</tag> is encountered or the entire
pipeline fails. In other words, outside of a <tag>p:try</tag>, step
failure causes the entire pipeline to fail.</para>

<para>Dynamic errors raised by steps are divided into two categories:
dynamic errors and step errors. The distinction is largely that “step
errors” tend to be related to a particular step or small group of
steps (e.g., validation error) whereas the “dynamic errors” apply to
many more steps (e.g., URI not available). There is also precedent for some
of the error codes dating back to XProc 1.0.</para>
